## Introduction
Using [RnBeads](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1664-9) to analyze Illumina Infinium mouse methylation data.  

## Custom probe annotation
I had to create a custom RepeatMasker (mm10) to compare beta values between cell types/treatment at repetitive elements. Struggled a bit, but eventually got [it](https://github.com/epigen/RnBeads/issues/34).

## R Markdown
To practice writing Rmd, and demonstrate some key functions and visuals, I wrote RnBeads_with_RepeatMasker.Rmd, which I rendered into .html and .pdf. PDF didn't always look so nice on Github according to some tutorials I've read.
